        <p1> I have two children, Inaya 11 and Ayaan 6. 
            They are both in primary school and keep me very busy. I am a Biomedical Scientist and wish to progress 
        in my field which is moving forward with technology. My main aim is to eventually find a job where i can 
        choose to work from home to spend more time with the kids.</p1>
        <p2> My second aim is to become closer to my dean and become more aware through learning i have started reading
            with translitiration in urdu and hope to next read with translitiration in english to the kids and then move on
            to the translation. i have become better with my five times prayer and i hope and pray to continue this good change.
